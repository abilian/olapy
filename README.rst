OlaPy, an experimental OLAP engine based on Pandas
==================================================

About
-----

**OlaPy** is an OLAP_ engine based on Python, which gives you a set of tools for the development of reporting and analytical
applications, multidimensional analysis, and browsing of aggregated data with MDX_ and XMLA_ support.

Installation
------------

Install from PyPI
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can install it directly from the `Python Package Index <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/olapy>`_::

    pip install olapy


Install from Github
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The project sources are stored in `Github repository <https://github.com/abilian/olapy>`_.

Download from Github::

    git clone git://github.com/abilian/olapy.git


To set up the application, run, ideally in a virtualenv::

    poetry install

**[OPTIONAL]**

you can use `Spark <https://spark.apache.org/docs/0.9.0/python-programming-guide.html>`_  instead of `Pandas <https://pandas.pydata.org/>`_, to do so, you need just to install it::

    pip install pyspark

and if you want to go back to pandas just uninstall spark with::

    pip uninstall pyspark

Usage
-----

Before running OlaPy, you need to initialize it with::

    olapy init

and then you can run the server with::

    olapy runserver


and then from excel, open new spreadsheet and go to : Data -> From Other Sources -> From Analysis Services and use http://127.0.0.1:8000/ as server name and click next, then you can chose one of default olapy demo cubes (sales, foodmart...) and finish.

that's it ! now you can play with data
