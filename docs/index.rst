OlaPy - OLAP Engine
===================

**OlaPy** is an OLAP engine based on Python, which gives you a set of tools for the development of reporting and analytical applications, multidimensional analysis, and browsing of aggregated data with `MDX <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MultiDimensional_eXpressions>`__ and `XMLA <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML_for_Analysis>`_ support.
It can be found in
`GitHub <https://github.com/abilian/olapy>`_. or `PyPI <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/olapy>`_.

- It is fast and uses in-memory technology and various techniques (aggregation and real-time computation) to provide sub-second responses.

- It includes an ETL layer (Extract Transform Load) for better data handling.

- It support most common databases (Postgres, MySql, Oracle, SQL Server) and CSV file format (only CSV right now) to construct cubes.
